###To see the working components of the controller (especially with rqt and terminator to have all the components work at the same time), 
###build the controller node and run the local publisher after also running ROS2's joy node. Then, echo the following in separate terminals:

ros2 topic echo /cmd_vel

# See button arrays
ros2 topic echo /btn_array

# See D-pad arrays
ros2 topic echo /dpad_array


###They'll show you the components of the controller when it is plugged in!
